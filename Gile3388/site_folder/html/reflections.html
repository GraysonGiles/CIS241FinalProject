 Looking back, I had a lot of fun taking CIS 241. I tend to enjoy the problem solving aspects of programming but typically with the kind of coding 
 that I've done you don't get that immediate visual feedback that you get working with web pages. The most enjoyable time I had in Web Development was
definitely applying what we learned in the material to this Competency Project. I really appreciated watching my Competency Project 
 slowly come together into something that resembled an actual website.

 Before taking this class I knew what HTML was and had heard of CSS but I didn't know their individual purposes or how they worked together. Ultimately, 
 the biggest ah-ha! moment of taking Web Development was when we starting using HTML in conjuction with CSS. Learning that HTML is somewhat like the bones
 of a webpage and CSS is somewhat like the skin answered the only question I had entering this class (what are HTML and CSS used for and how are they different from each other).

 Going forward, I would like to learn more about JavaScript and make another more responsive and interesting website. I personally think it was enjoyable
 to create this website but I can't imagine that it's particulary interesting to visit. So in the future I would like to learn enough to make a website that
 is just as interesting for the user to visit as it was for me to create. Again, thanks for visiting.
