<h2><u>Exercise</u></h2>
<p class="margin">
I tend not to be too vocal about it because it can get annoying, but I am a huge advocator for exercise. It makes you look better, has immense health benefits, 
and brings mental health benefits as well, just to name a few perks. I personally focus on resistance training but there are plently of different routines out there that 
may work better for you, here are some of my favorites for beginners:

<h2><u>Music</u></h2>
<p class="margin">
I get a lot of enjoyment out of listening to music just like almost eveyone else on the planet, but I also really enjoy playing guitar when I find the time. Having
a hobby that takes as much practice as playing an instrument can be really difficult to keep up with sometimes and I wish I played more than I do currently. However,
when I perfect a song or technique that I've spent a lot of time on it is one of the best feelings ever. Here are some songs I enjoy playing:

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fAQhSRLQnM">Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozXZnwYTMbs">Metallica - Nothing Else Matters</a>
